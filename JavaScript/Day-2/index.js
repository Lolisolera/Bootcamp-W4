const firstName = "Lola";
const lastName = "Marquez";
console.log(`Hello,  ${firstName} ${lastName}!`);
alert(`Hello,  ${firstName} ${lastName}!`);

//2: Create variables storing your name, your favourite colour and your favourite film or tv series. Using template literals I want you to log a sentence including these values to the console.

console.log(`My name is ${firstName}. ${favouriteColor} is my favourite color and ${favouriteFilm} is my favourite film.`);
